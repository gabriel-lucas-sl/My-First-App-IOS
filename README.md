# Dicee Project

This is a little project that I developed in the fourth section of Angela Yu's IOS development <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank">course</a>. The general idea of this app was to introduce some basic programming concepts with Swift, using Storyboards.
